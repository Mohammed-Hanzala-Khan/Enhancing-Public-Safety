# Public Safety Predictive Analysis: Key Insights

### Crime Type Distribution
Analysis revealed Part-1 crimes (e.g., robbery, assault) were more frequent than Part-2 crimes, indicating a higher occurrence of severe incidents requiring targeted intervention.

### High-Risk Demographics
Hispanic/Latin/Mexican individuals experienced the highest victimization rates, followed by White and Black populations, highlighting the need for community-specific safety initiatives.

### Peak Crime Periods
Data indicated early-year months (Jan–Mar) have the highest crime rates, aligning with post-holiday and seasonal economic factors, while midday hours (11 AM–12 PM) surprisingly saw the highest hourly crime rates, emphasizing a need for increased patrols during daytime.

### Age Vulnerability
Individuals aged 21–40 were most frequently victims, reflecting increased exposure due to active social and work lifestyles within this age group.

### Predictive Modeling Insights
Logistic Regression identified location, environment type, victim age, gender, and weapon presence as significant predictors of crime type. A model comparison pipeline found Random Forest performed best, achieving a KS (Youden) score of 0.55 with a low misclassification rate, indicating stable predictive capacity for identifying part-1 and part-2 crime susceptibility.
