# Recommendations

### Increase Midday Patrols
Allocate additional patrol resources during midday hours (11 AM–12 PM) when crime rates peak, enhancing deterrence and rapid response.

### Target High-Risk Demographics
Develop community-focused safety initiatives for Hispanic/Latin/Mexican populations, including education on crime prevention and improved local security measures.

### Implement Seasonal Crime Prevention
Increase patrols and community awareness campaigns during early-year months (Jan–Mar) to address seasonal crime spikes effectively.

### Leverage Predictive Policing Models
Adopt AI-driven predictive models like Random Forest to forecast high-risk periods and locations, enabling proactive resource deployment.

### Enhance Public Safety Education
Run public safety and situational awareness programs targeting the 21–40 age group to reduce victimization through informed prevention strategies.

### Invest in Data-Driven Decision-Making
Commit to continuous data collection, cleaning, and model refinement to maintain predictive accuracy, reduce misclassification, and address data biases for ethical and effective safety interventions.
