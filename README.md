## Key Results
- Analyzed **499,999 crime records** to identify patterns and risk factors for victimization.
- Developed and compared **five machine learning models**, with the **Random Forest model** achieving the highest performance.
- Identified crime hotspots and key demographics at risk, aiding targeted public safety initiatives.

---

## Project Objective
Leverage data analytics and machine learning to predict and understand the likelihood of an individual becoming a victim of Part 1 or Part 2 crimes, supporting law enforcement in enhancing public safety and community well-being.

---

## Dataset
Collected from **DATA.GOV**, containing crime data from Los Angeles, including demographic, temporal, and environmental variables across **18 columns** and **499,999 records**.

---

## Data Preparation
- **Excel**: Managed dataset dimensions and removed redundant columns.
- **Python**: Identified missing values for effective cleansing.
- **SAS Viya**: Advanced cleaning, feature engineering, and preparing data for predictive modeling.

---

## Visualization & Analysis
- Explored key questions, including most frequent crime types, highest risk demographics, crime seasonality, and peak times.
- Developed models including **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and ANN**, identifying **Random Forest** as the top performer.

---

## Key Insights
- **Part 1 crimes** are most frequent in Los Angeles.
- **Hispanic/Latin/Mexican** communities are the most victimized.
- **Start of the year** and **noon periods** have the highest crime rates.
- Individuals aged **21-40** are at higher risk due to active lifestyles and higher exposure.
- **Environmental, demographic, and location factors** are strong predictors for victimization.

---

## Recommendations
- Increase **midday patrols** and resource allocation during peak times.
- Provide **targeted support and education** to high-risk demographics.
- Launch **seasonal crime prevention campaigns**.
- Use predictive models like **Random Forest** for hotspot prediction and proactive safety planning.
- Continuously update and refine models with **clean, recent data** to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Uphold ethical data use, ensuring privacy and fairness.

---

## Future Work
- Integrate **real-time data streams** into the model for live monitoring.
- Expand predictive modeling with **advanced ensemble methods**.
- Automate deployment pipelines for actionable insights for law enforcement.
- Explore collaborations with community organizations for **public safety awareness and prevention initiatives**.
